## A problem on a Prostate Specic Antigen (from [1]), used to screen men for prostate cancer. P(+|C) is the probability of the screen having positive outcome if the screened person has cancer; P(−|C) probability of the screen being negative on healthy men; P(C) is the prior probability of having prostate cancer in the population of interest.  
  
 - P(+|C) = 3/4  
 - P(−|C) = 89/96  
 - P(C) = 4/100  
  
### 1. Compute p(C|+)
### 2. What do you think of this number? Did you expect it to be lower or higher?
### 3. Plot p(C|+) when p(+|C) goes from 0 to 1.

We solve this problem in the script.R
